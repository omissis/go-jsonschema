title: MyObject
type: object
properties:
  foo:
    description: >
      I'm a multiline description in a folded block. Folded blocks should not
      have hard line breaks after parsing. They should also not end in a line break.
    type: string
  bar:
    description: |
      I'm a multiline description in a literal block. Literal blocks, on the other hand,
      should have hard line breaks and may end in a line break, too.

      This may look funky when Go code is generated to a specific line width, though.
